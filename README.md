# Path of Exile Mod repository
Interactive repository of mods in Path Of Exile and their interaction with items, monsters etc.

## Usage 
This is in its current state probably not very useful for newer players. 
If you dont know anything about crafting, mods or masters then you should probably start learning about it on the [Wiki](http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Path_of_Exile_Wiki) and come back here later.

See the [disclaimer in the ui](http://eps1lon.github.io/poe_mod_repository/gui.html) (non existent atm).
